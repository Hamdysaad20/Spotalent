## Pro Tip for `main.tsx`

Instead of manually declaring each route in your `main.tsx` file, streamline your routing configuration by creating a route configuration array. This array will contain all your routes, including their paths and components, allowing you to dynamically generate the routes.

### Step 1: Create a `routesConfig.ts` File

Define an array with your route paths, components, and types (e.g., public, guest, auth).

```typescript
// routesConfig.ts
import Home from './Home';
import Auth from './Auth';
import Settings from './Settings';
import Editor from './Editor';
import Article from './Article';
import Profile from './Profile';
import GuestRoute from './GuestRoute';
import AuthRoute from './AuthRoute';

const routesConfig = [
  { path: "/", element: <Home />, type: "public" },
  { path: "/register", element: <Auth key="register" />, type: "guest" },
  { path: "/login", element: <Auth key="login" />, type: "guest" },
  { path: "/settings", element: <Settings />, type: "auth" },
  { path: "/editor", element: <Editor />, type: "auth" },
  { path: "/editor/:slug", element: <Editor />, type: "public" },
  { path: "/article/:slug", element: <Article />, type: "public" },
  { path: "/profile/:username", element: <Profile />, type: "public" },
  { path: "/@:username", element: <Profile />, type: "auth" },
];

export default routesConfig;
```

### Step 2: Map Over the Configuration in `main.tsx`

Use the configuration array to dynamically generate your routes.

```typescript
// main.tsx
import React from 'react';
import { Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';
import routesConfig from './routesConfig';

const App = () => (
  <Routes>
    {routesConfig.map((route, index) => {
      switch (route.type) {
        case "guest":
          return <GuestRoute key={index} path={route.path} element={route.element} />;
        case "auth":
          return <AuthRoute key={index} path={route.path} element={route.element} />;
        default:
          return <Route key={index} path={route.path} element={route.element} />;
      }
    })}
  </Routes>
);

export default App;
```

### Benefits

- **Reusability:** Easily add or modify routes by updating the `routesConfig` array.
- **Maintainability:** Centralized route configuration makes it easier to manage and scale.
- **Less Repetition:** Avoid manually writing out the `<Route>` or custom route components for each route.

This approach centralizes your route management, reduces repetition, and makes it easier to add or modify routes as your application grows.
